# OnIt

## Project Description

With OnIt, a user can create a highly customizable, visually pleasing to-do list. They can view a graph showing how many they've completed over the past <number specified by user> days, as well as download their task list to a file! All of these features are accessible after registering for an account and signing in.

## Technologies Used
* Angular
* HTML
* CSS
* Typescript
* Angular Material
* Bootstrap
* Java
* Spring (Core, MVC).
* Hibernate.
* PostgreSQL.
* Apache Tomcat.
* JUnit.
* Mockito.
* Log4j.
  
## Features
With OnIt, a user can:

* Register for an account.
* Sign in to a user home page displaying a filterable (by category, by whether it has been completed) grid list of their tasks.
* Create and edit a task with a name, description, due date, category label, (optional) location via Google Maps and can (optionally) be marked as repeatable. 
  Each task also has an option to send an email reminder to the user one day before its due date.
* View their "Task Stats", where a curve graph shows them how many tasks they've completed over the past n days, where they specify n via a dropdown box.
* Download their task list to a file.
* Update their account information, or delete their account.

To-do's:
* Allow users to specify their own category label for a task instead of (only) offering a set list of choices,
* Show additional data related to user productivity on the "Task Stats" page.
* Send email to a user when they register.
